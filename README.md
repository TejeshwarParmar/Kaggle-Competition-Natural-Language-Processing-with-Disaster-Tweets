Text Classification Model for [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets]
This project aims to solve the text classification task for the [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/] hosted on [https://www.kaggle.com/]. The objective is to predict the target label based on the text provided in the dataset. The model is optimized to maximize the F1 Score for classification accuracy, balancing both precision and recall.

Overview
The solution implements a text classification pipeline with several machine learning techniques to preprocess, vectorize, and model the text data. We explore the following steps:

Text Preprocessing: Data cleaning (removing special characters, URLs), tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Feature Engineering: Use of TF-IDF Vectorization with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for contextual understanding.
Modeling: Training multiple models and combining them using Stacking Classifier to achieve the best performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters using RandomizedSearchCV to achieve the best F1-score.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model on validation data using the F1-score, precision, and recall.
Libraries Used
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
scikit-learn: Machine learning and model evaluation
nltk: Natural Language Processing (for tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization)
numpy: Numerical operations
re: Regular expressions for text cleaning

Approach
1. Text Preprocessing
The text is preprocessed by performing the following operations:

Lowercasing: Converts all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
URL Removal: Removes any URLs in the text.
Special Character Removal: Strips out any non-alphabetic characters.
Tokenization and Lemmatization: Breaks down the text into tokens and lemmatizes the words (reduces words to their root form).
Stopword Removal: Filters out common words like "the", "and", "is", etc., that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text.

2. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert the cleaned text into numerical features:

Max Features: Limited to 5000 to reduce dimensionality.
N-grams: The model uses unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to capture context between words.
3. Model Selection
We experiment with several models:

RidgeClassifier
GradientBoostingClassifier
LogisticRegression
SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
Each model is tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.

4. Stacking Classifier
A Stacking Classifier is used to combine the predictions of all base models (Ridge, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and SVC). A Logistic Regression meta-model is used to make the final predictions based on the output of the base models.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
We perform RandomizedSearchCV for each model to explore a wide range of hyperparameters.
The goal is to optimize the model based on the F1-score, which balances both precision and recall.

7. Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated on the validation set using:

F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Precision: The accuracy of the positive predictions.
Recall: The ability of the model to find all the relevant cases in the dataset.
7. Prediction and Submission
After selecting the best model, we predict the target labels for the test data and save the results into a CSV file (submission_optimized_stacking.csv) for submission.

Results
The model is evaluated using F1-score, which was the key metric in this competition. The stacked ensemble of Ridge, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and SVC models helped achieve a high performance on the validation set.

Conclusion
This approach leverages multiple machine learning techniques to create a robust model for text classification. The combination of multiple models using Stacking and the fine-tuning of hyperparameters with RandomizedSearchCV helped achieve the best possible performance on the validation set.

By fine-tuning preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and stacking classifiers, we aim to achieve a high F1-score and improve predictions for the test set.
